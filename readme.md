# Steps

## Lets start by building our frontend

We will use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to initialize our frontend.  
Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

```
npx create-react-app frontend

cd frontend

npm start
```

After that you can open newly created frontend on http://localhost:3000.

Main React component that used to render the page is `src/App.js`. Open that file and try making changes to jsx.
